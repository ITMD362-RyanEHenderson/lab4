## ITMD 362 Lab 4: Color Palettes

For this lab, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site 
Paletton, http://paletton.com. Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste 
the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette. You’ll see that the uid value in 
the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make. Write 2 sentences 
explaining why you chose the colors you did. Opt for the Paletton Preview mode 
Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: 
http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Create a Basecamp post "Lab-4: your name" and simply post the following as plain text. 

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52I140k5eoB0SES2Jtm8wkHcIh2
Your Rationale: I tend to think of consoles as a bit more muted in color, so I brought it closer to white. The green primary with the purple and yellow make for colors that don't go badly together, and I don't want them to pop very much.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=33H120kxRKfiJMfpoKjKKw2M6oP
Your Rationale: I went with bright colors that make me think of flowers, since it's for botanical gardens. The red and yellow complement the blue really well here.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=35j0e0klZqi9TE4gRueqCmMv3i-
Your Rationale: A login page should be simple, so I went with having my 2 complementary colors pretty close together, a lime and green. The magenta contrasts with the green.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=1000e0kp4n-cVvNjOqJsZjCAPf7
Your Rationale: The theme for Ruby is obviously red, so I went with a medium strength red. Then adjust a bit to get the color just right.
